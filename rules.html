	Hi Friend! Thanks for choosing to spend these valuable moments of your life on this Battleship game. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Now here are the rules:
	<br>
	<br>
	There are three ships that have been randomly generated on to the game board. Now, you currently can't see them. But they're there.
	<br>
	<br>
	Each ship takes up  three boxes. Either three boxes adjacent horizantally or three boxes adjacent vertically.  Not diagonally. It's like
	scrabble in that way. Your goal is to sink all three ships. 
	<br>
	<br>
	All you have to do is just click on a box on the game board. Don't even think about it. No need for strategy.
	Just click on a box. Either you hit a ship or miss. Once you sink all three ships, you won! Great job!
	</p>
